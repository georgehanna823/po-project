# Page Object Project

*Finding page objects.*

**Java 7**

* Maven
* TestNG 6.11

Locate your choose of any 4 items by any of the location strategies at two of the following urls using the PageObject approach, also create a method which clicks on an item you located :

		1. http://www.shell.com
		2. http://www.usa.siemens.com
		3. http://eni.com
		4. http://sap.com
		5. http://bp.com
		6. http://unilever.com
		7. http://nestle.com
		8. http://roche.com
		9. http://novartis.com
		10. http://gsk.com

You will want  to find 4 items and give a location strategy for that item. Similar to previous exercise although this should be easier to locate the element. We will discuss creating a page object from the specific websites.
